============================================
Configure the OpenStack environment settings
============================================

You can configure security, compute, storage, logging, and other
settings in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab. Most of these settings you have
already configured in the deployment wizard.

Additionally, you can configure some of the advanced OpenStack settings
by editing the corresponding configuration files.

**To configure the OpenStack environment settings:**

#. In the Fuel web UI, click :guilabel:`Settings`.
#. Select a coresponding tab and edit as required:

   .. list-table:: **OpenStack environment settings**
      :widths: 10 25
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Name
        - Description
      * - **General settings**
        - Access
           Enables you to modify access permissions for Horizon.
           By default, Fuel assigns user name, password, and tenant *admin*.
          Repositories
           Fuel includes default repositories from which it downloads the
           packages required to install and update Fuel and OpenStack
           components. If you do not have an Internet connection, you can
           set up a local repository and provide the URL to the repository on
           this page. For details, see: :ref:`local-repo`.
          Kernel parameters
           Enables you to modify kernel parameters. This field does not set
           kernel parameters for the Fuel Master node or for nodes that have
           already been deployed.

      * - **General settings: Kernel parameters**
        - ``ttys0=<speed>``
           Enables serial console for videoless servers.
          ``console=ttyS0,9600``
           Enables serial console.
          ``nofb``
           Disables Linux framebuffer.
          ``nomodeset``
           Disables the video card kernel handling. This parameter may be
           required for old integrated server video chips.
          ``intel_iommu and amd_iommu``
           Enables/disables physical-to-virtual address translation for
           peripheral devices. Some devices, such as Mellanox cards,
           require this parameter to be enabled. Other peripheral devices
           may be incompatible with device virtual address space and may only
           work with real address space. If you are unable to boot a node or
           the node has a kernel panic soon after being booted, setting this
           parameter to ``off`` may resolve the issue.
          ``unsupported_hardware``
           Instructs the operating system to boot even if it does not
           recognize some of the configured hardware. Failure to set
           this parameter may result in inability for Linux to boot. This
           typically happens with the latest CPU models. Because most
           hardware provides backward compatibility with older versions,
           setting this kernel parameter may enable the system to boot.
           However, if no backward compatibility is provided, the system
           may panic or fail in other ways even with this parameter set.

      * - **Security settings: Public TLS**
        - TLS for OpenStack public endpoints
           Enables TLS termination on HAProxy for OpenStack services.
          HTTPS for Horizon
           Secures access to Horizon enabling HTTPS instead of HTTP.
          Select source for certificate
           Enable :guilabel:`TLS for OpenStack public endpoints`
           first to select a certificate. You can generate a private
           key with certificate or use the pre-generated ones.

           * Self-signed
              Generates a private key and certificate to be signed by this key.
           * I have my own keypair with certificate
              Uses the pre-generated key and certificate. If selected, you need
              to specify a certificate and private key data concatenated into
              a single file.

          DNS hostname for public TLS endpoints
           Enable :guilabel:`TLS for OpenStack public endpoints` first
           to specify a DNS hostname. Your DNS entries should point
           to this name. Self-signed certificates also use this hostname.
           The default value is ``public.fuel.local``.

      * - **Security settings: SSH security**
        - Restrict SSH service on network
           When enabled, provide at least one working IP address
           (the Fuel Master node IP is already added).
           Add new addresses instead of replacing the provided
           Fuel Master node IP address. When disabled (by default),
           the admin, management, and storage networks can only connect
           to the SSH service.
          Restrict access to
           Sets access restriction to the specified range of IP addresses.
          Brute force protection
           Grants access from all networks (except the provided ones),
           but Fuel checks the networks against the brute force attack.

      * - **Security settings: Security groups**
        - Open vSwitch Firewall Driver
           Select the Open vSwitch Firewall Driver if you use OVS Bridges
           for networking.
          IPtables-based Firewall Driver
           Select the IPtables-based Firewall Driver if you use Linux
           Bridges for networking. Do not select this option if you have
           DPDK enabled as this results in not having a firewall at all.

      * - **Compute settings**
        - Hypervisor
           Enables you to modify the previously selected option.
          Nova quotas
           Sets tenant quotas on CPU and memory usage.
          Resume guests state on host boot
           Controls whether to preserve the state of virtual instances
           across reboots.

      * - **Storage settings**
        - Use qcow format for images
           If you select this option, ephemeral volumes will be created as a
           copy-on-write layer of the base image. If you do not select this
           option, ephemeral volumes will be full copies of the base image.
           The default setting is to use copy-on-write for ephemeral
           volumes.
           If you select to use Ceph RBD as a storage back end for ephemeral
           volumes, this setting is ignored.
          Storage Backends
           Modify storage options you have previously selected in the
           deployment wizard. The storage options that you select must match
           the roles you assign to a node. For example, if you select
           Ceph as a storage back end, you must configure the appropriate
           number of nodes with the *Storage - Ceph OSD* role.
          Ceph object replication factor
           Determines the minimum number of Ceph OSD nodes that Fuel must
           deploy. For a production environment, deploy at least three Ceph
           OSD nodes.

      * - **Logging settings**
        - Configure the Puppet and OpenStack debug logging and syslog
          settings.

          Common
           Typically, you do not need to enable debug logging. Enable debug
           logging to analyze the problems in your system.
          Syslog
           Fuel deploys an OpenStack environment with the standard Linux
           syslog message logging tool. Syslog logs activity of all
           OpenStack services. By default, ``rsyslog`` is
           configured to use the Fuel Master node as a remote syslog server
           that contains all logs generated on all nodes in the OpenStack
           environment. If you want to use an external server for
           ``rsyslog``, specify an IP address and port number of the server
           in the :guilabel:`Syslog` field.

      * - **OpenStack services**
        - Select additional OpenStack services to deploy. Some OpenStack
          services may have additional network and storage requirements.
          For more information, see:
          :ref:`configure-additional-components`.
